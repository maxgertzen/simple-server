Server intro exercise ;-)

This is a working server using node http module!

It's a simple server that can be launched by typing in terminal:
> node index.js

When you change something, you must close (Ctrl+c twice) and rerun it.

*The server is up and running ALL the time, until you shut it down, or an error crashes it.


Instructions:

1- Complete the /json route by returning the customers to the client
2- Add another route
   /saints
   Which will send back only the saints
3- Add another route
   /short-desc
   Which will send back only the customers names and occupations.
   Show it in an html table.
4- Add another route
   /who?name=abraham
   (This is called: query parameter)
   This route will send back only the given customer (name=rachel will send back 'No such customer')
   (If you change to /who?name=miryam and hit enter, Miryam data should be shown)
5- Update /saints
   /saints?isSaint=true
   Which will return saints or not saints, depending on the query parameter

Debug!
Debug!
And once more - Debug!
This is the way to inspect the request object and see where the relevant data lays.
